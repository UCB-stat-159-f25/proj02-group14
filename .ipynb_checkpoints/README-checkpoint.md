# Project 2: Reproducibility in Natural Langauge Processing
(Repository for Project 2, Stat 159/259 Fall 2025)

## Project Goals:
The goal of this project is to explore reproducibility specficially within natural language processing through the use of a collection of presidents' US State of the Union speeches. We were looking to:
    * Create a reproducible environment suitable for analysis
    * Load speech data into a dataframe that included information like the year, speech text, president name, etc. 
    * Conduct further data analysis on:
        * Number of speeches per year 
        * Number of speeches per president 
        * Analyze word count distribution
        * and more!
    * Build an NLP pipeline via spaCy that:
        * tokenized speech text
        * used lemmatization to normalize words 
        * removed unnecessary tokens 
    * Complete the bonus section to analyze how the frequency of selected words changed over time
